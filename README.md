# Micro frontends

This is a forked version of https://github.com/dpizzuto/microfrontends-integration-pattern

My modifications aim to 
 - [done] show a bootstrap project that is angular based, the original was 'raw html'
 - [todo] check whether custom elements works in IE11 (i.e. ensure polyfill works correct)
 - [todo] see whether different angular versions can be used in the same bootstrap
 - [todo] see whether there are any problems with this approach with ivy (angular 9)
